# EEG_GRAPH_CONVOLUTIONAL_NEURAL_NETWORK

The project deals with the classification of electroencephalographic signals coming from patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease, patients suffering from frontotemporal dementia and control patients.

EEG signal classifications with graph convolutional neural network

The EEG.ipynb file contains the data from the exploratory data analysis phase performed with MNE Python.

The PythonColabCode.ipynb file contains the development of the neural network that classifies electroencephalographic signals.
